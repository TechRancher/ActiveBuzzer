.Description of the project
We will use the active buzzer and a potentiometer to make the active buzzer
buzz at different potentiometer levels. We will also change the delay time to 
make the active buzzer produce different frequencies of buzzing.

.Items Needed
* One 10k Ohm potentiometer
* One TMB12A05 Active Buzzer
* One Arduino R3 
* One Breadboard
* Seven jumper wires

.Circuit Design
On the breadboard I installed the active buzzer postive leg at column 15 and the
negative leg to column 18. I installed the left leg of the 10k ohm potentiometer 
in column 30, with the middle leg into column 32, and the right leg into column
34. Now it is time to run the jumper wires. I ran the GND from the Arduino R3 GND
to the GND rail. Jumper wire from pin 8 on the Arduino to column 15. Jumper wire
5V on the Arduino to positive rail on breadboard. Jumper wire from pin A0 on the
Arduino to column 32. I ran jumper wire from GND on rail to column 18. Jumper wire 
from positive rail to column 30. Then the last jumper wire from GND rail to column
34. This should close the circuit.

.Code
The code for this project is in the file called "WorkingBuzzer.ino".

.What To Expect
Once the code is done and you upload to the Arduino, you are ready to turn the 
potentiometer to see if your active buzzers buzzes at you. We coded Serial.println
to display the potentiometer's value so you can see if and when the buzzer changes
frequencies. You can go and change the delay times to make the frequencies change.
Not much other then hearing the buzzing change pitch to this circuit, but still 
good practice to work on wiring and coding. Good refresher for how to read the 
potentiometer's value differents and make something change do to it.
